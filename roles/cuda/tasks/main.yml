# Disable the nouveau driver before installing the cuda toolkits:
- name: persistently blacklist nouveau
  become: true
  copy:
      src: blacklist-nouveau.conf
      dest: /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf

- name: regenerate the initramfs

  copy:
      src: cuda.sh
      dest: "{{ lookup('env', 'HOME') }}/.bashrc.d/env.d/cuda.sh"

# yamllint disable rule:line-length

# The run file for installing cuda is downloaded from:
#     https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/9.1/Prod/local_installers/cuda_9.1.85_387.26_linux
# Note that only Ubuntu 16.04 and 17.04 are supported.  And, on top of that,
# Ubuntu 17.04 has reached end of life Jan 2018.

# The cudnn tar file is downloaded after logging into the nvidia developer port.

# The --override flag causes the installation to proceed while bypassing the
# checks that would have normally been performed and prevented the installation
# from proceeding.  It is highly recommended that the system be rebooted after
# the installtion.
#- name: force install cuda to custom locations

#  shell: "./runfile.run --silent --override --driver --toolkit --toolkitpath=/opt/cuda/9.1 --samples --samplespath=/opt/cuda/9.1/samples"


# The installtion of cudnn cannot be automated.  It requires logging into
# nvidia's developer port..
