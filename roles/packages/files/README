git-lfs:

    The officially recommended installation is:
        curl -sL https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.     sh | sudo bash
        sudo apt install -y git-lfs

    This approach works in the US where the network is reliable and fast.
    However, in China, the network is too slow.

    I installed git-lfs using this approach in the US and repacked the .deb file
    from my installation via dpkg-repack:
        sudo apt install -y dpkg-repack
        fakeroot -u dpkg-repack git-lfs


nodejs:

    The officially recommended installation is:
        curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo bash
        sudo apt install -y nodejs

    But it suffers from the same issue as git-lfs.  The .deb file is exported
    via:
        fakeroot -u dpkg-repack nodejs
